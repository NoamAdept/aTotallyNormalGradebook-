# 🎮 WarGames: Secure Gradebook System 🚀

## 🔥 Overview
Welcome to the **WarGames Secure Gradebook System**, a terminal-based hacking simulation inspired by the 1983 classic film *WarGames*. Your mission: 🕵️‍♂️ Infiltrate the system, bypass security, and access classified student grade records. **Will you play a game?** 🎲

## 🛠 Features
- 📞 **Dial-up Connection:** Just like in *WarGames*, access to the system requires dialing a **randomly generated phone number**.
- 🔐 **Secret Credentials:** The **admin password and phone number change every session**, keeping the system "secure" (or not 👀).
- 🖥 **Admin Dashboard:** Once inside, manipulate student grades, uncover hidden information, and decrease the DEFCON level.
- 📜 **Grade Complaint System:** Submit a "harmless" grade complaint, which may or may not contain **a format string exploit**. 😈
- 🔍 **Leaked Information:** Slowly extract critical secrets from the system **digit by digit**. 🕵️‍♀️
- 🚨 **DEFCON Level Mechanics:** Your actions impact the system's **DEFCON status**, ultimately leading to… who knows what? 🤯
- 🏆 **Winning Condition:** Successfully infiltrate the system, and you will be rewarded with a **WarGames-style victory message**. 🎉

## 💻 Installation & Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🖥 A Unix-based terminal (Linux/macOS) or Windows Terminal with curses support

1. **Run the script:** 🏃‍♂️
   ```bash
   python secure_gradebook.py
   ```
2. **Dial into the system:** ☎️ Enter the correct **555-XXXX** phone number.
3. **Explore your options:** 🕵️‍♂️
   - `'l'` - Attempt an **admin login** (if you dare 😏).
   - `'c'` - Submit a **grade complaint** (definitely not a vulnerability here 😅).
   - `'s'` - View **classified student records** (once inside the admin panel 🏫).
4. **Win the game:** 🎊 Successfully breach all defenses and witness the legendary message:
   ```
   SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? 🤖
   ```

## ⚠️ Security Vulnerabilities (For "Educational" Purposes Only) 🤫
- 🔒 **Hardcoded Admin Username**: *Joshua?* No, but close. 🤖
- 📝 **Format String Exploit**: Let the system do the work for you. 🏗
- 💥 **Buffer Overflow Simulation**: Because nothing says "secure" like `eval(input)`. 🙈
- 🕵️ **Secret Leaks**: Extract secrets, one digit at a time—just like real hacking! 🕶
