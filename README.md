# aTotallyNormalGradebook-
Welcome to the WarGames Secure Gradebook System, a terminal-based hacking simulation inspired by the 1983 classic film WarGames. Your mission: 🕵️‍♂️ Infiltrate the system, bypass security, and access classified student grade records. Will you play a game? 🎲


🛠 Features

📞 Dial-up Connection: Just like in WarGames, access to the system requires dialing a randomly generated phone number.

🔐 Secret Credentials: The admin password and phone number change every session, keeping the system "secure" (or not 👀).

🖥 Admin Dashboard: Once inside, manipulate student grades, uncover hidden information, and decrease the DEFCON level.

📜 Grade Complaint System: Submit a "harmless" grade complaint, which may or may not contain a format string exploit. 😈

🔍 Leaked Information: Slowly extract critical secrets from the system digit by digit. 🕵️‍♀️

🚨 DEFCON Level Mechanics: Your actions impact the system's DEFCON status, ultimately leading to… who knows what? 🤯

🏆 Winning Condition: Successfully infiltrate the system, and you will be rewarded with a WarGames-style victory message. 🎉

💻 Installation & Requirements

🐍 Python 3.x

🖥 A Unix-based terminal (Linux/macOS) or Windows Terminal with curses support

🎮 How to Play / Hack the System

Run the script: 🏃‍♂️

python secure_gradebook.py

DEFCON 5:
Dial into the system: ☎️ Enter the correct 555-XXXX phone number.

DEFCON 4:
Figure out the admin password...

MORE DEFCONS TO BE ADDED!


SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? 🤖

⚠️ Security Vulnerabilities (For "Educational" Purposes Only) 🤫

🔒 Hardcoded Admin Username: Think... maybe Moses' most devout student. 🤖

📝 Format String Exploit: Let the system do the work for you. 🏗

💥 Buffer Overflow Simulation: Because nothing says "secure" like eval(input). 🙈

🕵️ Secret Leaks: Extract secrets, one digit at a time—just like real hacking! 🕶
